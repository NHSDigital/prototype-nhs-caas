      <p>On the advice of NHS England, people who only qualify for a COVID-19 vaccination because they are pregnant are not included in the digital pathway.</p>
      <p>In some areas of England, people who are pregnant can get their vaccination through antenatal clinics. In other regions, they will need an appointment at a GP surgery or a pharmacy offering the vaccination.</p>
      <p>This applies to all people at any stage of their pregnancy (1st, 2nd or 3rd trimesters).</p>
