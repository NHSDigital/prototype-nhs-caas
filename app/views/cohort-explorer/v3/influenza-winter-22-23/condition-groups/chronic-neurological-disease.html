      <p>The information below shows the digital pathway rule logic for the conditions that have been identified for call and recall for the flu season winter 2022 to 2023.</p>
      <p>These conditions are detailed in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/influenza-the-green-book-chapter-19" title="External website">chapter 19 of the influenza Green Book</a>.</p>

      <!-- Condition Description -->

      <h3>Condition description</h3>
      <p>Conditions in which respiratory function may be compromised due to neurological disease (e.g. polio syndrome sufferers).</p>
      <p>Clinicians should offer immunisation, based on individual assessment, to clinically vulnerable individuals.</p>
      <p>This includes those with:</p>
      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li>cerebral palsy</li>
        <li>learning disabilities</li>
        <li>multiple sclerosis and related or similar conditions</li>
        <li>hereditary and degenerative disease of the nervous system or muscles</li>
        <li>severe neurological disability</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Stroke, transient ischaemic attack (TIA).</p>

      <!-- Ruleset -->

      <h3>Ruleset</h3>
      <p>People who are:</p>
      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li>over 6 months of age</li>
        <li>recorded with chronic neurological disease</li>
      </ul>

      <p>and also people who are:</p>
      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li>over 6 months of age</li>
        <li>recorded with a learning disability</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Data used -->

      <h3>Data used</h3>
      <p>GPES v4 and GDPPR</p>

      <!-- Non-Digital Pathways -->

      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l" id="non-digital-pathways">Non-digital pathways</h2>
      <p>Data that is held within a GP clinical system does not hold a patients complete medical records. This means that a percentage of the patients identified within the clinical policy will not have been captured in the digital patient cohort.</p>
      <p>If you believe you are entitled to an NHS flu vaccination and you have not been included in the digital cohort, you can <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/flu-influenza-vaccine/">visit the NHS website on the flu vaccine</a>.</p>
      <p>Eligibility for flu vaccination where respiratory compromise is variable (such as in multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy), may not be included in the digital cohort unless a GP practice adds a SNOMED CT administrative code.</p>
      <p>Stroke and TIA conditions are included in the digital pathway.</p>
